    - message: >-
        The deprecated implementation in course/view.php, which uses the
        extern_server_course function to handle routing between internal and
        external courses, can be improved by utilizing the Hook API. This
        enhancement is essential for a project involving multiple universities,
        as the Hook API provides a more generalized and flexible approach to
        route users to external courses from within other plugins.
      type: improved
