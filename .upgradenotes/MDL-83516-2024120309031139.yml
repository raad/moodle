notes:
  tool_mfa:
    - message: >-
        The new factor management table uses `plugin_management_table`, so not only the functions that changed, but the file needs to be
        moved from `admin/tool/mfa/classes/local/admin_setting_managemfa.php` to `admin/tool/mfa/classes/table/admin_setting_managemfa.php`
      type: improved
    - message: >-
        The two language strings in the tool_mfa plugin, namely `inputrequired` and `setuprequired`, are deprecated.
      type: deprecated
    - message: >-
        Introduce the new language string `settings:shortdescription`, which is mandatory for each factor.
