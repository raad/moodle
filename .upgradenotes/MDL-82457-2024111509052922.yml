        Remove chat and survey styles. Important note: the styles have been
        moved to the plugins as CSS files (and not SCSS) so themes might now
        need to override the mod_chat and mod_survey styles specifically as css
        does not have any definition for primary, gray and other colors
        accessible in the original scss version.
