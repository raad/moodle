    - message: >
        The Moodle subplugins.json format has been updated to accept a new
        `subplugintypes` object.


        This should have the same format as the current `plugintypes` format,
        except that the paths should be relative to the _plugin_ root instead of
        the Moodle document root.


        Both options can co-exist, but if both are present they must be kept in-sync.


        ```json

        {
            "subplugintypes": {
                "tiny": "plugins"
            },
            "plugintypes": {
                "tiny": "lib/editor/tiny/plugins"
            }
        }

        ```
