issueNumber: MDL-83718
notes:
  core_reportbuilder:
    - message: >-
        Report table instances no longer populate the `countsql` and
        `countparams` class properties. Instead calling code can access
        `totalrows` to obtain the same value, rather than manually counting via
        the prior properties
      type: changed
