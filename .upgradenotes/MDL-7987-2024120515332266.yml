        Behat steps `behat_qbank_comment::i_should_see_on_the_column`
        and `behat_qbank_comment::i_click_on_the_row_containing` have been
        deprecated in favour of the new component named selectors,
        `qbank_comment > Comment count link` and
        `qbank_comment > Comment count text` which can be used with the
        standard `should exist` and `I click on` steps to replace the
        custom steps.
      type: deprecated
