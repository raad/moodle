  core_question:
    - message: >
        The definition of the abstract `core_question\local\bank\condition`
        class has changed to make it clearer which methods are required 
        in child classes.

        The `get_filter_class` method is no longer declared as abstract, and
        will return `null` by default to use the base 
        `core/datafilter/filtertype` class. If you have defined this method
        to return `null` in your own class, it will continue to work, but
        it is no longer necessary.

        `build_query_from_filter` and `get_condition_key` are now declared as
        abstract, since all filter condition classes must define these 
        (as well as existing abstract methods) to function. Again, exsiting
        child classes will continue to work if they did before, as they 
        already needed these methods.
      type: changed
