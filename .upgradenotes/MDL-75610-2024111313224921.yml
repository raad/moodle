        `\core\output\activity_header` now uses the `is_title_allowed()` method
        when setting the title in the constructor.


        This method has been improved to give priority to the 'notitle' option
        in the theme config for the current page layout, over the top-level
        option in the theme.


        For example, the Boost theme sets
        `$THEME->activityheaderconfig['notitle'] = true;` by default, but in its
        `secure` pagelayout, it has `'notitle' = false`.

        This prevents display of the title in all layouts except `secure`.
      type: improved
